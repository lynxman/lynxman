### ü¶æ What I have been doing lately

Learning a ton about LLM and AI, plenty of good stuff from [Patrick Debois](https://github.com/jedi4ever).

Looking at the deployment space and thinking how can we make this better for everyone, Kubernetes has some really good solutions but there needs to be a way to make this easier for people outside of the K8s space. Special interest in what is happening with [FluxCD](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) and [ArgoCD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd).

Researching new ways to shorten the latency in Linux networking through [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) and to apply it to Kubernetew through [Cillium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium).
